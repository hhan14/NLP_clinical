Micra,MEDTRONIC INC.,Leadless pacemaker,Death,09/20/2018,Elderly male undergoing a Micra pacemaker placement for bradycardia: a 27 French delivery sheath was in place for delivery of the device to the right atrium. A delivery catheter containing the Micra device was inserted into the sheath and delivered to the right ventricle under fluoroscopy guidance. Per the procedure report - the delivery catheter advanced easily. Initial contrast injection showed the delivery system to be just above the right ventricular (RV) apex.  The delivery catheter was pulled back and easily repositioned on the mid RV septum. Contrast injections were made showing the delivery capsule to be in good position.  The pacemaker was deployed - and the delivery catheter pulled back slightly. Doctor noted that pacing and sensing thresholds were tested and noted as good. Contrast injections were made showing the delivery capsule to be in good position. The pacemaker was deployed. Pacing and sensing threshold tests were repeated - and noted to be good. The tether was cut and removed. The delivery catheter was withdrawn and removed.  During pacing threshold testing - the patient was noted to have a low systolic blood pressure. Fluroscopy was used to check for air in the RV; none was seen. A stat echocardiogram was completed showing a moderate sized anterior pericardial effusion. The pericardial space was tapped removing 100mLs of blood. Despite these interventions - the patient continued to deteriorate.   Resuscitative measures were continued. A pigtail drain was successfully placed - and bloody pericardial fluid withdrawn. External CPR and defibrillation were administered without improvement.  Open cardiac massage was performed by cardiothoracic (CT) surgeon. Upon examination by the CT surgeon - a 2.5 cm laceration at the RV apex and a second 2.5 cm laceration in the RV outflow tract was found. Both lacerations were repaired but the patient continued to bleed. Despite prolonged resuscitative efforts - the patient expired. Per the procedure note - it is believed that Per the procedure note - it is believed that the second 2.5 cm laceration in the RV outflow tract likely occurred due to CPR.

Reocor D - External Pacemaker,BIOTRONIK INC.,PULSE GENERATOR EXTERNAL PACEMAKER DUAL CHAMBER,Potential for patient harm;Minor injury to the patient or health care provider,09/05/2018,At a critical time in the surgery - the pacemaker and cable failed to properly function. The patient's heart quickly distended and a hole was then emergently made in the heart to decompress the heart in order to save the patient. Once a proper functioning cable and box were retrieved (2 boxes later) - the hole that was emergently made needed to be fixed
Reocor D - External Pacemaker,BIOTRONIK INC.,PULSE GENERATOR EXTERNAL PACEMAKER DUAL CHAMBER,Potential for patient harm,08/29/2018,Patient was being taken off the bypass machine and team was trying to get the heart started again. Pacing wires were inserted in the heart and connected to the Biotronic pacing cables and paced with the Biotronic pacing box. Both the surgeon and the anesthesiologist have been doing this for many years. The pacing didn't work with the first set of cables and box. Team changed out the cables - that didn't work. Team next changed out the box – that didn't work either. The team moved the actual pacing wires on the heart to make sure they were in a good place – that didn't work. The cables were changed out again –  still didn't work. The team again changed out the box – again - didn't work. After a third unsuccessful try of changing everything - Another manufacturer pacer and cables were requested. Everything was changed out one more time while we were waiting for these to arrive - third try again didn't work.     Once the other manufacturer pacer arrived we hooked it up and it immediately started pacing.  This needs to be discussed and a solution put in place for the safety of the patients.

Assurity MRI,St. Jude Medical,Implantable pulse generator pacemaker (non-CRT),Not known,02/28/2018,Unable to visualize radiopaque marker that is supposed to confirm identity of a MRI conditional model pacemaker.  From Radiologist: I was asked to approve this MRI with pacemaker and we were given the documentation and we had the cardiologist telling us it was a certain device - we had the card telling us it was that device - we had the company telling us it was that device - the problem is that in the documentation that was provided they said specifically for that model number (on pages 5&6) you should see a radiopaque marker. We could not see a radiopaque marker.  I talked to the representative from the company who was there and she provided an image which sort of looks like a netters image of the pacemaker.  The left third of it looked just like what I saw in the radiograph - the right third looked just like what I saw in the radiograph - but the middle third did not.  And so - I didn't have a radiopaque marker and I had documentation saying that I should see it.  In that situation - it is the job of the radiologist to make sure that everything we are provided with is concordant.  I was provided with documentation saying that I should see this marker.  I was provided with all the other information in the saying that its a pacemaker which should have this marker - but I didn't see that.  So - we contacted the company - and the company said they were uncomfortable providing us with any sort of statement saying you don't always see the marker - and the company was also uncomfortable with providing us five example radiographs of what the pacemaker may look like.  At that point we didn't feel like we could treat this as a MRI conditional pacemaker simply because the documentation saying the marker should be visible was not in alignment with the reality of a radiograph that didn't show the marker.
FLEXTEND®,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION,permanent pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,02/15/2018,A latitude remote transmission was done. Patient was found to have new right ventricle (RV) lead noise. Implanted for syncope - rvp: 5%. Patient was brought into office 4 days later and was unable to recreate noise with provocative maneuver's. There was a stable RV lead with impedances and thresholds. Noise was random and larger than 5 mv. It was unable to be programmed around and still have adequate sensing. Will go for lead revision.
Medtronic,Medtronic,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Potential for patient harm,02/14/2018,Our facility is experiencing widespread failures of the lead connector of our Medtronic 5392 pacemaker fleet. Degradation - cracks - and damage of the lead wire connector causes the lead set to have a loose - intermittent connection or to fall out completely. About 44% of our fleet is affected at this point. To date - we have identified 25 of our 57 pacemakers with damage to the connector. The fear is that eventually - we will lose functionality of the pacemaker while on a patient - or not have a working pacemaker available when it is needed for patient treatment.    Medtronic has indicated that the problem is related to the disinfectant used at the hospital. Medtronic has also indicated that the pacemakers should be cleaned with alcohol. Alcohol is not an effective disinfectant. I am currently awaiting some follow up information from Medtronic regarding proper cleaning of the pacemakers.    Manufacturer response for External Pacemaker - Medtronic (per site reporter)  ======================  Medtronic has indicated that the pacemakers should be disinfected with alcohol only. I am currently awaiting follow up information regarding other disinfectants that may be used.

Myopore,St. Jude Medical (Greatbatch Ltd),Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,01/15/2018,Pre-op cardiology consultation:  Patient with a history of cardiomyopathy with chronic congestive heart failure - who recently had placement of a biventricular pacemaker.  The anatomy limited lead placement options and lead displacement inferior posterolateral position.  It does function - but cardiology does not believe that it is in optimal position.  We were consulted for surgical insertion of left ventricular lead.    Plan: The patient would benefit from bronchoscopy - left video-assisted thoracic surgery - epicardial left ventricular (LV) lead placement and left atrial appendage ligation.  This would allow us to under direct visualization - place the LV lead in a higher midlateral position to allow for better resynchronization and optimization of the heart function.     While undergoing insertion of a dual chamber biventricular pacemaker - the left ventricular epicardial lead failed to capture. It was removed and another epicardial lead was then utilized. There were no complications.    Operative report findings: Significant adhesions secondary to two prior open heart coronary bypass grafts - multiple areas tested for left ventricular lead placement until final resting spot obtained.  Impedance was 804 Ohms - threshold was 1.1 volts set as a unipolar lead with a 1 millisecond pulse width and 3.0 volts set as a bipolar lead with a 1 millisecond pulse width.  The new pacemaker device was a biventricular pacing device.      Cardiology progress note assessment: Left ventricular lead placed in inferior posterolateral position based on limited anatomic options - now with epicardial LV lead.

CapSureFix Novus MRI™ SureScan®,MEDTRONIC INC SWINNEA,permanent pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,08/08/2017,A patient with symptomatic nonreversible bradycardia - tachybrady syndrome underwent implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker. During the surgery the right ventricular (RV) lead was found to have high impedance: Above 2200 unipolar; above 2400 bipolar. The lead was tried in 3 locations: apex and 2 septal. The lead was removed and replaced with the same model.  Notes from surgery:  A dilator and introducer were advanced over the existing guidewire and through this an active fixation bipolar ventricular pacing electrode was inserted.  The lead was guided across the tricuspid valve - out the right ventricular outflow tract and then seated within the floor of the right ventricle.  Here - while the pacing thresholds were acceptable - the impedance was extremely high.  We withdrew the lead and advanced it into the apex where similar finding was confirmed.  Similarly 2 locations within the intraventricular septum also yielded similar high impedance recordings.  We began to suspect the lead was deficient or damaged in some way from the manufacturer.  We left the lead and place within the distal intraventricular septum for later measurement.    Using the retained guidewire - a second dilator and introducer were inserted.  Through this - an active fixation bipolar atrial pacing electrode was inserted.  It was guided into the region of the right atrial appendage where it was actively secured.  Lead position was stable and the pacing parameters were acceptable as follows:  Capture threshold 1.1 volt at 0.5 milliseconds pulse width with an impedance of 656 ohms and P waves of 2.4 millivolts.  Returning to the right ventricular lead - we once again found extremely high impedance of greater than 2000 and elected to withdraw the lead and return it to the manufacturer.  This was accomplished without difficulty.  The surgery was completed - and there were no complications.

When the physician was trying to place the Micra Leadless pacemaker - there was no capture. The device was removed - and a new device was inserted. The new device seated well and showed good capture and impedence. No injury to the patient.
Energen,Boston Scientific Corporation,implantable pulse generator pacemaker (non-crt),Potential for patient harm,12/28/2016,Notes from the history and physical: The patient has coronary artery disease including left main coronary - which was stented with a drug-eluting stent in 2014.  He has had resumption of his anginal symptoms.  His treadmill exercise test apparently shows no ischemia. The patient has a cardiomyopathy and an ICD was implanted for a history of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  His ejection fraction is 40%.  The VVI device (ventricular pacing and sensing) has not provided therapy. The patient has a longstanding mechanical aortic valve - which has a ball cage configuration and he has been on chronic Coumadin therapy.    IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATION:  This device has prematurely reached elective replacement indicator...There has been a rapid depletion of battery - however - over the past several weeks with some function of the device being documented as abnormal leading to some concerns about either inappropriate therapy or absence of the ability to deliver therapy under the proper circumstances if required.  The surgery is accordingly going to be undertaken urgently.  Notes from the operative report: This was a VVI device.  The leads were disconnected from the header of the device - and the patient paced externally.  He had complete heart block with no underlying rhythm.  The chronic pacing thresholds were determined and were satisfactory as follows for this single bipolar electrode in the right ventricle capture threshold 1.1 volt at 0.5 milliseconds - impedance 395 ohms.  No intrinsic R waves and shocking impedance was determined at 41 ohms.  These data were acceptable.  The old device - a Boston Scientific model E141 was removed from the field.    The new device was connected to the leads.  This was a Boston Scientific model D141.  The device and leads were returned to the modified pocket and the device secured to the chest wall using the suture port provided.  The patient tolerated the procedure well - and there were no complications.

The patient was scheduled for ICD generator change Friday - with Boston Scientific. The explanted device is located in Risk Management Dept(RM). There was no patient harm.
Durata,St. Jude Medical Implantable Electronic Systems Division,drug eluting permanent left ventricular (lv) pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,09/22/2016,The patient had rising impedance in the single lead - and was suspected of having a lead fracture - so was evaluated for lead replacement surgery. The cardiologist's report indicates: rising  ventricular lead impedance from 1450 to 1975 over the past month or two. No history of ICD shocks.  The patient underwent laser lead extraction:  The existing lead was freed from its adhesions to the fibrous capsule of the pocket down to its insertion site.  A stylet was passed down the lead and active fixation device withdrawn.  This was a quadripolar lead with dual coils.  Traction on the lead - alone - failed to dislodge the lead.  Accordingly - the lead was amputated and a laser locking stylet passed down its course.  Even with traction with the locking stylet - we failed to dislodge the lead; therefore a 16-French excimer laser was mobilized.  Using the laser technology - the lead was removed in its entirety....With a dilator and introducer inserted - we advanced a new quadripolar dual coil electrode.  We guided it out the right ventricular outflow tract and into the floor of the right ventricle.  It was seated in several locations within the floor of the ventricle until adequate pacing thresholds could be obtained and these were as follows:  R waves of 10 millivolts - impedance of 540 ohms and a threshold of 0.8 volts at 0.5 milliseconds pulse width.  This was satisfactory.  The lead was secured to the chest wall and hemostasis assured.  The lead was placed back in the header of the device - St. Jude model 1311-36Q.  There were no complications.
Tendril,St. Jude Medical Inc.CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DIVISION,IMPLANTABLE PACEMAKER PULSE-GENERATOR,Potential for patient harm,09/14/2016,During procedure - active fixation lead defected -  it would not screw into RA tissue.  No patient harm. Device returned to manufacturer.
BM Bi-Polar Temporary Pacing Wire,MEDICAL CONCEPTS EUROPE,electrode pacemaker temporary,Potential for patient harm;Minor injury to the patient or health care provider,09/12/2016,Patient underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in late December - 2014.  He had temporary epicardial pacing wires placed at the time of surgery.  The patient was discharged from the hospital six days after surgery.  He had follow up clinic visit a month later and was doing well at that time per progress note.  The epicardial pacing wires were cut prior to discharge leaving a portion of the wire internal.  The practice for pulling wires vs. cutting wires is surgeon dependent and patient dependent.  This practice varies across the country and per hospital policy.  At times the risk of pulling wires poses greater risk to the patient than leaving wires.  CV surgeon was notified by outside provider that recent radiology study showed a foreign body which appeared to be a wire in the patient's pulmonary artery.  The interventional Radiologist was able to retrieve the foreign body from the patient. The foreign body appeared to be a pacing wire.  The wire would have had to migrate from epicardial space through the myocardium and into the heart to the pulmonary artery.  The Cardiologist can find no reported cases in the literature and requested this event be reported to the FDA.  The pacing wire was taken to Pathology and is stored.  Unfortunately I was just made aware of this event and issue.  The wire has been secured in our Pathology department since January.
Flextend,Boston Scientific Corporation,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,08/17/2016,Notes from the cardiac consultation: The patient presented with recurrent near syncope -.. very brief syncope - clearly associated with failure to capture on her ventricular lead in the setting of pacemaker dependency.  The patient has a history of dual chamber pacemaker in March 2015 - RV septal/OT positioning - with near 100% pacing. The patient reported an occasional jabbing or jolting sensation to her chest wall.  Her device interrogation was fairly normal except what appears to be an isolated drop in her RV lead impedance from 800s to 500s within the past 2 weeks - but both of these values are within a normal range.    Notes from the operative report:  A stylet was placed down the pre-existing right atrial and right ventricular leads.  The active fixation mechanism of the right ventricular lead was withdrawn.  The lead easily fell from the outflow tract.  Using slow steady manual traction - the right ventricular lead was removed from the patient.    There were no complications.

Rate decreased to 40 as patient was requiring intrinsic beats. Pacer did not sense appropriately - and fired on a T wave sending the patient into V -Tach requiring defibrillation.  After defribillation - patient returned to sustainable heart rhythm.  Pacer was removed and sent to bio-med. Medtronic Representative here the next day and informed of incident.  Review meeting the following day - unsure if device related.
Tendril,ST. JUDE MEDICAL CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DIVISION,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,12/30/2015,The patient went to cardiologist office for evaluation of their pacemaker and then was scheduled for lead revision.  When the pacemaker pocket was opened during surgery it was found that there was a break in the insulation of the RV lead.  The old RV lead was removed and a new RV lead was placed.
Teligen,Boston Scientific Corporation,implantable pulse generator pacemaker (non-crt),Potential for patient harm,12/28/2015,The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) was implanted about 6 years ago. The device had reached a premature elective replacement indication. This resulted in the inability for the device to charge and deliver an appropriate shock. The ICD was explanted and a new ICD was implanted. This ICD is part of a Boston Scientific Advisory.    
Attain Select II,Medtronic Inc.,drug eluting permanent left ventricular (lv) pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,11/19/2015,The cardiologist's consultation noted: The patient had the original ICD implanted in late March - 2010. At that time - the patient had a class III systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% and prolonged QRS duration. Since that time - the patient has done well - but on recent analysis - the device had reached the Elective Replacement Indicator (ERI) and had a high left ventricular pacing threshold of greater than 5 volts with a low impedance of less than 200 ohms. This was presumptive evidence of a coronary sinus/left ventricular lead fracture. The patient was referred for generator change and surgical management of his leads.  Notes from the operative report: The implanting incisional scar in the left anterior chest wall was elliptically excised and the incision carried down to enter the ICD pocket. There were dense adhesions around the leads incorporating the remainder of the fibrous capsule. The leads were mobilized and considerable portion of the fibrous capsule especially in the cephalad portions of the pocket and the posterior wall of the capsule were excised. The left ventricular lead was examined and appeared to be normal throughout its course. On fluoroscopic examination - it was difficult to identify along its entire length because of being obscured by larger defibrillator lead with coils present. Nevertheless - this lead measured independent of the connections to the header of the device showed high pacing threshold of greater than 5 volts and a very low impedance of less than 200 ohms - suggesting that the lead was fractured somewhere along its course....  An attempt was made to extract the left ventricular coronary sinus electrode under fluoroscopic guidance with gentle traction on the lead - only. This was unsuccessful. Accordingly - the lead was amputated and a laser locking stylet passed down its course. An excimer laser was mobilized and the lead was removed in its entirety. The lead did begin to unravel but this did not present any significant problems in extracting the entire lead without complication.  The patient tolerated the procedure well - with no complications.
Quartet;Endotak,St. Jude Medical CRMD;Boston Scientific Corporation,drug eluting permanent left ventricular (lv) pacemaker electrode;drug-eluting permanent defibrillator electrodes,Minor injury to the patient or health care provider,11/17/2015,...[patient]presented with RV lead failure to capture and LV lead with high thresholds resulting in bradycardia and VF arrest.

STS Tendril,St. Jude Medical Inc.,Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Serious injury,09/14/2015,On postoperative day #1 after pacemaker implant - interrogation revealed a lead malfunction. A Procedure was scheduled to reposition the lead - however the lead still did not seem to advance easily. The Physician removed lead intact and without incident and noticed blood in the lead insulation. The lead rep was consulted and a decision was made to replace faulty lead with new lead. The procedure continued without incident and patient left catheterization lab in a stable condition.
Ellipse DR;Durata,St. Jude Medical,Implantable Pulse Generator Pacemaker (Non-CRT);Permanent Defibrillator Electrodes,Potential for patient harm,09/01/2015,Notes from the history and physical: The patient had an AICD implanted two years ago and is known to have ICD malfunction with detection on the lead.  However - on lead interrogation the impedances where normal and there was no definite evidence of fracture and it was felt that both the ICD lead and her ICD generator may have to be replaced for device/lead malfunction.  The patient then underwent removal of the AICD lead - removal of defibrillator - and implantation of defibrillator with leads. The patient tolerated the procedure well - and there were no complications.    
FineLine II,Boston Scientific Corporation,Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,08/24/2015,Upon extraction of the Right Ventricular lead (the old pacing lead) - approximately 2-3 cm. of the distal lead lodged in a stenosed subclavian vein. Notes from the cardiac cath team: Existing right ventricular pacemaker was a Guidant model number 4470. A 52 cm Stylet was placed in the body of the lead and using gentle traction - the lead was removed from the right ventricle and retracted all the way into the subclavian vein. However - the lead could not be removed beyond the subclavian vein and during traction the distal tip of the lead broke.  The next day - the patient - in Interventional Radiology - underwent successful endovascular retrieval of 2 cm retained pacer lead fragment by left internal jugular vein access under fluoroscopic guidance. There was no disruption of indwelling biventricular pacer wires. The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was discharged home on the following day in stable condition.
Identity ADx SR,St. Jude Medical Inc.,Implantable Pulse Generator Pacemaker,Potential for patient harm,07/31/2015,Following a Pacemaker Generator change out - it was noticed by the St. Jude Rep that the Pacemaker was not pacing. It was determined by x-ray that the Ventricular lead was not placed (screwed) in the generator correctly. We had to reprep the patient - set up for another procedure and reopen the pocket to screw the lead into the generator. This caused prolonged case.  After closing the pocket when the pacemaker was being   re-interrogated - it was found that the ventricular lead had a very high  impedance and further evaluation revealed that the pin connecting the lead to  the generator was not making contact. At this point - the pacemaker   company representative mentioned that some pacemakers may have been   coming from the factory with the pin clamping screw not set correctly.  After some discussion - the pocket was reopened and that turned out to be   the case. The pin was adjusted and retightened. Thereafter - excellent   measurements were obtained. The generator was replaced in the pocket -   irrigated again with several hundred cc's of triple antibiotic solution and closed.       ======================  Manufacturer response for pacemaker generator - St. Jude 5386 (per site reporter)  ======================  rep on site
Endotak Reliance;Adapta,Boston Scientific Corporation.;Medtronic Inc.,implantable cardioverter defibrillator (non-crt) lead electrode;implantable pacemaker pulse-generator,Potential for patient harm,06/25/2015,The Medtronic pacemaker and RV lead were removed for an ICD BI-V upgrade. The new dual coil RV ICD lead that was implanted was removed due to failed DFT's. The single coil RV ICD lead was removed due to the wrong lead being handed off and not realized until insertion.
Clarity Lead,Medtronic Inc.,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,06/25/2015,Patient suddenly had a change in his stimulation. Evaluation of the stimulator showed impedances to be abnormal. The patient therefore presents for revision.
Tendril STS Pacing lead,St. Jude Medical,lead pacemaker,Potential for patient harm;Minor injury to the patient or health care provider,06/01/2015,Patient returned to the OR for insertion of Permanent Pacemaker after open heart procedure.

Flexstend;Flextend,Boston Scientific Corporation,Drug Eluting Permanent Right Ventricular (Rv) Or Right Atrial (Ra) Pacemaker Electrodes,Potential for patient harm,04/28/2015,The patient was present for a Dual Chamber Pacemaker implant. The right ventricular lead was positioned but the Helix would not retract - causing malfunction and lead removal. Boston Scientific Pacing lead Flextend model 4087-52 cm.  Lead #2 inserted: Right Ventricular Lead with another malfunction of the Helix:it will not retract. we removed the Pacing lead. Boston Scientific Pacing Lead Flextend Model 4087-52cm..   After removal of this lead - the MD inspected it and noted that the lead would not extend or retract. No resistance was noted.    Here are the notes from the operative report: The right ventricular lead was then advanced to the right ventricular apex under fluoroscopic guidance. The lead was positioned and screwed in using active fixation mechanism. Pacing and sensing characteristics were obtained - pacing with 10V did not cause diaphragmatic stimulation.     Unfortunately - attempts at repositioning the lead were challenging due to failure of the active fixation mechanism to retract. This lead (Guidant 4087) was removed from the patient and a new lead was introduced. Astonishingly enough - this lead (Guidant 4087) was challenged by failure of the active fixation mechanisms to deploy. This too was removed. One trend was frequent - easy cannulation of the coronary sinus and middle cardiac vein - but this was atraumatic. We then advanced a Fineline to the right ventricle. The lead was positioned and screwed in using active fixation mechanism. Pacing and sensing characteristics were obtained - pacing with 10V did not cause diaphragmatic stimulation.   There were no complications.
ConchaTherm III;Tendril;Victory,Teleflex Medical;St. Jude Medical Inc.,humidifier respiratory gas (direct patient interference);Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,04/07/2015,St. Jude tech reset pacemaker and blamed heated trach collar for interference. Respiratory therapy asked to remove device.    From what I read in the chart - the patient was due for a pacemaker interrogation. There is a sheet that shows the testing that was done by the St. Jude's tech but I do not see any narrative notes by the tech - nursing - respiratory therapy - or the provider regarding suspected interference of the trach collar with the pacemaker. This patient continues to be in our hospital and the heated trach collar has been placed back on the patient. If the claim from the tech is true that these devices interfere with each other we need to take action to prevent them from being used together and we would also want the manufacturer to investigate since this poses a patient safety risk. If it interferes with pacemakers - what else does it interfere with?    The reporter of this event said he sent the Conchatherm to biomed but that department does not have any documentation of receiving the Conchatherm. Perhaps it was not tagged to be tested.
Zephyr XL DR,St. Jude Medical,Pacemaker,Serious injury,03/31/2015,95 year old with history of complete heart block. Pacemaker implanted 2012. At an office check visit - it was noted that the device was beyond the end of life and he was admitted  for pacemaker replacement.During procedure he was noted to be in complete heart block and no underlying R waves could be detected.Leads were then connected to a new pacemaker.
External Pacemaker,Medtronic Inc.,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Potential for patient harm,03/24/2015,During routine preventative maintenance (PM) it was found that the latching mechanism preventing unintended disconnection of leads from the pacemaker were broken.  This allowed leads to be pulled straight out of unit.  Normal operation requires a button to be depressed on the leads as a prerequisite to disconnection.  This has been found during 4 PMs on 4 different 5392 devices.  Additionally - 2 other devices were sent back to Medtronic for repair for the same issue.  Disconnection of leads would result in cessation of life-supporting pacing function.

NanoStim,Nanostim,implantable pacemaker pulse-generator,Serious injury,12/30/2014,Physician inserted the leadless pacemaker in to the right ventricle and it was affixed to the septum.  Shortly thereafter - patient began complaining of chest discomfort and dizziness - thus the pacemaker was unscrewed and removed along with the sheath.  Patient became apneic and hypotensive.  CPR was started.  A catheter was inserted and a liter of blood was removed.  Cardiovascular surgery was consulted and patient was taken to the OR to repair a perforation of the right ventricle.
,Boston Scientific Corporation,Permenant Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,12/19/2014,Notes from the patient's (pt.) history and physical: pt. has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome with symptomatic bradycardia.  Had a pacemaker implanted in nine months previously.  Did well initially - but was followed in the office and found to have high atrial impedance with the impedance being greater than 2000 ohms. Pt. is 90% atrially paced.  The device was turned to VVI backup pacer only.Was seen for consideration of lead revision.    The operative report notes:The device was delivered into the wound and we checked the placement of the leads within the header hoping that indeed the high impedance on the atrial lead might relate to contact issue with the header.  The lead was well seated and the set screw was secured.  The lead was withdrawn from the header of the device and was analyzed independently.  The impedance on the lead was greater than 2000 ohms.    Given the patient having had left subclavian vein occlusion - which proved a challenge for the original implant - we elected to remove all hardware from the left side proceeding to new implant on the right side..We disconnected both leads from the header of the pacer - which we removed to the back table for later use.  The leads were mobilized down to their insertion site and the fibrous capsule of the pocket was almost completely excised.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  A stylet was passed down each lead in turn and the active fixation device was withdrawn.  Under constant fluoroscopic visualization - we removed both leads in their entirety by applying gentle traction constantly - only.  Exam of the atrial lead showed no discernible interruptions either in insulation or the conduction material...the patient tolerated the procedure well.

Fineline II,Boston Scientific Corporation,drug eluting permanent right ventricular (rv) or right atrial (ra) pacemaker electrodes,Potential for patient harm,05/21/2014,The patient had a history of high-grade AV block - and had a pacemaker implanted five years ago.  Soon after the pacemaker implantation - the patient had a perforation of the right ventricular lead and a new right ventricular lead was placed last year; bypass surgery following that - was noted to have atrial lead malfunction with noncapture and poor sensing. The patient appeared to have symptoms related to pacemaker syndrome.Removal of pacemaker leads: stylet was placed in the body of the lead and the lead was dissected down to the anchoring sleeve and using manual traction - the lead was eventually removed.  The patient appeared to have some adhesions proximal to the tip of the lead - but the tip of the lead appeared to be normal with no myocardial tissue.  The patient did not have any hemodynamic compromise during this lead extraction - which was monitored closely with the anesthesiologist using transesophageal echocardiogram. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complication.  
,MICROPACE PTY. LTD.,GENERATOR PULSE PACEMAKER EXTERNAL PROGRAMMABLE,Not applicable,05/14/2014,The patient was scheduled for an electrophysiology study / atrial fibrillation radiofrequency ablation.  The micro-pace system would not boot up so the case had to be cancelled.
Adapta Lead,Medtronic,lead pacemaker,Potential for patient harm,04/29/2014,Upon examination discovered that the lead migrated and there was an perforation. The lead was replaced and the perforation healed naturally. The lead was sent to the manufacturer for an investigation.
CapSure Epi,Medtronic Inc.,Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Not known,04/28/2014,This patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus - cerebrovascular accident - end stage renal disease - and is a hemodialysis patient with an infected right arteriovenous fistula - bilateral chronic thrombus in jugular vein - and superficial thrombus right cephalic vein. He came to facility with endocarditis of Mitral valve - Clostridium difficile - MRSA bacteremia - third degree heart block and a transvenous pacemaker in the right groin which had been there for several weeks. The plan was to perform a mitral valve replacement and implant a permanent pacemaker - after treating him with 6-8 weeks of antibiotics for his sepsis. However - the doctor needed to implant the pulse generator at approximately 18:00 four days later. According to the doctor - the generator was interrogated after placement and was functioning well. The doctor received a call at approximately 23:46 the following night that the patient was coding in the cardiovascular ICU. Transvenous pacemaker was turned on and the patient was resuscitated - but he suffered an anoxic brain injury after the code blue. He lived until four days later - when family removed him from life support and he expired. Per doctor - the strips she pulled indicate that the pulse generator slowly lost capture just prior to the code.
SELUTE PICOTIP,Boston Scientific Corporation,Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,04/25/2014,A patient's recent device interrogation revealed perpetually elevated atrial threshold and pulses per minute (PPM) at elective replacement indicator (ERI). The patient then underwent atrial lead replacement and generator change out. The old right atrial lead was removed transvenously without issue. There were no complications. Note: the original surgery was not performed at our facility; no documentation of implant date.
EASYTRAK 2;FINELINE II,Boston Scientific Corporation,drug eluting permanent left ventricular (lv) pacemaker electrode;Drug Eluting Permanent Right Ventricular (RV) Or Right Atrial (RA) Pacemaker Electrodes,Potential for patient harm,04/17/2014,This patient had an ischemic cardiomyopathy with symptoms of congestive heart failure and had a biventricular ICD implanted 2 years ago. The patient had an initial lead dislodgement requiring a return to the operating room for repositioning of the right ventricular dual coil electrode within 24 hours of the original implant. The patient has done well in the interval and has received no therapy. Recent analysis of his device - however - showed an impedance of 2000 ohms and inability to pace from the coronary sinus/left ventricular electrode. Chest x-ray demonstrated a fracture of this lead in the pocket.  From the operative report: We found that the patient had two leads - which were intimately associated with each other and coiled having migrated somewhat anteriorly so that they lie just beneath the skin. These two leads were the EASYTRAK left ventricular/coronary sinus electrode and a FINELINE right atrial electrode. Examination of the lead showed fractures of both leads - in fact the FINELINE lead was almost totally transected. From the discharge summary: The coronary sinus lead was positioned and was documented by standard static x-ray. This lead was then extracted without difficulty and without resorting to the use of a laser. A FINELINE lead - however - presented a problem in that on trying to extract the lead with traction alone it became ensnared and the innominate vein near the proximal coil of the defibrillator lead. A 12-French excimer laser was mobilized to remove this lead and unfortunately the lead broke with the tip of the lead retained in the distal innominate vein and again - apparently associated intimately with the proximal coil of the defibrillator electrode...The retained portion of the FINELINE lead was not delivered into the wound. It is attached to the defibrillator electrode remained in place. Further attempts at access from the left side were only partially successful and since we could not place all three leads from the left side - we abandoned the left side entirely. Attention was directed intraoperatively to the right side where biventricular ICD was implanted without difficulty with good positioning of a posterior LV branch of the coronary sinus obtained for the left ventricular pacing electrode....Postoperatively - the patient had no complications and progressed well and was discharged the following day.
CapSureFix Novus,Medtronic Inc.,Permanent Pacemaker Electrode,Potential for patient harm,04/09/2014,The patient was admitted for evaluation and possible pacer pocket infection. The patient states that the swollen area of his pacer pocket has doubled in the past couple of hours and has been problematic over the last two weeks... The initial pacer was placed three years ago. From the op note: The leads were examined. The ventricular lead had evidence of a small insulation defect. Using medical grade silicone - this lead was repaired - and a sewing ring (suture sleeve) was placed over the site of repair - and approximated using 0 Ethibond. A stylet was then placed in the non-functional right atrial lead. The active fixation mechanism was retracted - and using manual traction - the lead was removed completely from the body.... There were no complications - and the patient was discharged home in stable condition a couple days later.
FINELINE II,Boston Scientific,drug eluting permanent right ventricular (rv) or right atrial (ra) pacemaker electrodes,Potential for patient harm,04/04/2014,An elderly male patient had a pacemaker inserted approximately 5 years ago at another hospital. The patient was admitted this year with confusion - shortness of breath - coughs and was observed to be shaking. He was taken to the cardiac cath lab for a laser lead extraction - placement of a radial arterial line - pacemaker pocket revision - removal of existing central venous line port and a pacemaker generator removal due to a pacer pocket infection. Upon removal of one of the leads there was considerable resistance in the subclavian area as well as the heart. Additional traction on the atrial electrode resulted in its withdrawal to the proximal subclavian area. The electrode frayed from the main body leaving the ring and electrode tips remaining within the left subclavian vein. The patient was taken back to the cardiac cath lab days later to snare the electrode segment which was deemed successful. The patient was discharged the following day.
Adapta,Medtronic Inc.,Pacemaker Implantable,Potential for patient harm,03/14/2014,The patient was helicoptered in because of acute syncope and evidence for pacemaker failure. The cardiac surgeon noted: Patient with pacer - recently interrogated without demonstrable problems. Sudden loss of capture today with rhythm restored by EMT's use of transcutaneous pacing. Patient required intubation - sedation and paralysis for control... Device interrogated by rep from Medtronic- lead fracture. A new pacer generator was then inserted and connected to the new acute right ventricular lead and the chronic right atrial electrode. Pacing and sensing were appropriate. The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition to the PACU. In PACU - the pacer failed and she required a placement of a temporary transvenous pacer. The next day the patient returned to the OR for repositioning of the permanent endocardial right ventricular pacing electrode. Pacing and sensing remained appropriate and lead position was satisfactory. There were no complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.   The pacer needed to be replaced. According to the operative note: The old right ventricular lead was now abandoned. It was capped and curled up in the pocket and secured in several places... The patient had no electrical activity through the device to allow pacing. With these findings - we presumed that the pacer - itself - was the fault and the failure to pace experienced by the patient and resulting in her syncopal episode. Immediately - transcutaneous pacing was reinstituted...We analyzed the old right ventricular pacing electrode - which we had planned to abandon. The lead appeared to have adequate integrity with a pacing threshold that was less than 1 and an impedance that was now within the normal range of 600 to 800 ohms. Nevertheless - I was loathed to trust this lead because of the high impedances originally recorded. We had to presume at this time that the pacer itself had been at fault - and accordingly - we elected to remove this device from the field.

Pacesetter Tendril SDX,ST. JUDE MEDICAL,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,02/28/2014,BIV Pacemaker RV lead extraction and replacement due to high RV thresholds. RA lead extracted as well - because it was damaged during RV lead extraction. Generator replaced at time of lead revision as well.   Patient is a 76 year old man with a history of CHB for which dual chamber pacemaker was inserted originally about 10 years ago at outside hospital. Pt developed exercise intolerance and severe LV dysfunction - thought to be related to RV pacing and was upgraded to bi-ventricular device about three and a half years ago.  He recently underwent EGR and was found to have high RV thresholds - but due to vein occlusion - RV lead was not changed. He was referred to the EP clinic for evaluation - and RV lead extraction.

Model 5348 Single Chamber Temporary Pacemaker,Medtronic,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Potential for patient harm,02/05/2014,Temporary pacer with epicardial wires stopped working.  As patient is A-V paced and dependent she went asystolic and required immediate intervention of external transcutaneous pacing - which occurred.  This happened twice.  Battery was changed in-between both product failures and same result occurred.  Batteries had been newly placed just prior to implantation. The battery light indicator never flashed or indicated that the battery was the issue.  All wires were properly placed and confirmed by staff members.   External Medtronic Pacer box sent to clinical engineering and they were not able to replicate the event under their evaluation of the device.  This device malfunctioned; stopped working abruptly without any indication or warning of failure. This device was being operated by the clinical staff during the time of failure.. patient became asystolic after the external pacer stopped pacing. Another external pacer was immediately attached to the patient and patient returned to normal paced rhythm.  Upon further investigation - we have determined that there have been other cases in the past with these devices in our hospital abruptly stop pacing without warning despite brand new batteries in these units. Medtronic was made aware of these events and historically these devices have sent back to manufacturer for their evaluation. It was reported back to us from the manufacturer that there were no issues upon there examination.   
Altrua;Fineline II Sterox EZ,Boston Scientific Corporation,implantable pulse generator pacemaker (non-crt);Lead Pacemaker,Potential for patient harm,01/14/2014,There was a pacemaker ventricular lead malfunction. The lead had an impedance greater than 2500 ohms--non-capture via programmer - and confirmed at the procedure via Pacing Systems Analyzer. The patient was admitted electively for wire and battery change out. The cardiologist's operative report states: ...the old generator was explanted. At this point - the fractured right ventricular lead was dissected out - at which point a stylet was placed without difficulty through cardiac gentle counter-clockwise rotation and retraction.

Medtronic 5388 External Pacemaker;Medtronic 5388 Pacemaker,Medtronic Inc.,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Potential for patient harm,08/30/2013,An infant with a history of L-transposition of the great vessels - Ebsteinoid tricuspid (systemic) valve - Ventricular septal defect - atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus was admitted at birth.  Patient was status post placement of pulmonary artery band - ligation of PDA - ventricular septal defect enlargement - patch closure of the tricuspid valve - atrial septectomy and tracheostomy.  The patient had complete heart block - and so was pacemaker dependent.  The pacemaker was due for a battery change.  In preparation for the procedure - a second pacemaker was at the bedside and set for the patient's parameters.  The back-up pacemaker's batteries were changed first.  During the primary pacemaker's battery change - once the battery was placed in the pacemaker - the pacemaker's screen went blank and the patient's monitor showed asystolic heart rhythm.  The patient's arterial waveform went flat.  The staff quickly changed to the back-up pacemaker and so the patient did not suffer any ill-effects.  The pacemaker was sent to Biomed for evaluation.

Dual Chamber Temporary Pacemaker,Medtronic Inc.,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Minor injury to the patient or health care provider;Potential for patient harm,06/29/2013,External pacemaker failed to pace without notice. Compressions were performed for under one minute. A new external pacemaker was obtained and pacing was resumed. Performance test run and passed.  During testing low battery indicator comes on and goes off. Battery voltage 8.74 volts.  Spoke with Medtronic tech support about findings.  This possibly suggests that the battery contacts may be worn or have some contact issue going on with them. Low battery indicator should not come on until battery reaches 8.0 +/- 0.5 volts.
ASKU temporary pacemaker cable electrode,Medtronic,electrode pacemaker temporary,Potential for patient harm,06/28/2013,Patient had a CABG performed about two months ago. The patient was in intensive care until the day after the CABG when he was transferred to the Telemetry Unit. He remained in sinus rhythm until 3 days post-CABG (2 days after admission to the Telemetry Unit) when his heart rate became irregular at a rate 100-130s. He was started on Amiodarone and Lopressor. Two days after his heart rate became irregular - the patient was still in afib/aflutter and the patient's doctor attempted to rapid A-pace (atrial pace)the patient out of atrial flutter. The change in the pacer settings sent the patient into burst of ventricular tachycardia on the monitor. The patient became symptomatic from the rhythm change with visual shaking and diaphoresis. The doctor changed the settings on the pacer to a backup of VVI.  This change induced inappropriate pacer spikes on the monitor. MD was unable to change the sensitivity and reduce the inappropriate pacer spikes. The PA traced the wires from the external pacer box back to the patient. It was discovered that although the colors on the top of the box were coordinated - the wires were switched at the point where they exited the patient's body. Once the wires were switched back to the correct setting - the doctor was able to rapid atrial pace the patient of the atrial flutter and into atrial fibrillation. The patient subsequently converted back to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged home one day after the wires were switched back to the correct setting and conversion back to normal sinus rhythm. There is nothing to prevent this from happening again; no hard stop. The wires can go into either cable.    
Ingenio,Boston Scientific Corporation,implantable pulse generator pacemaker (non-crt),Potential for patient harm,06/27/2013,Patient had implantation of pacemaker. The patient sent Device Follow-up Report -via remote monitoring system approximately 26 days later - as instructed. Receiving Device Clinic nurse noted Approximate time to explant to be too soon for device that was just implanted. She spoke with manufacturer representative - who confirmed that there was a problem with the device. He evaluated the report in person the next day - and conferred with Technical Service - who suggested that the patient be brought in - so that information on PPM could be saved to a flash drive. The patient presented to the Device Clinic the following day to evaluate battery status. Battery status showed remaining longevity of battery at one year. The nurse notified the implanting physician of the finding. After the patient visit to the device clinic - the physician received a follow-up from Boston Scientific engineers recommending that the generator be replaced as soon as possible. The patient presented to the office the following day. It was explained to the patient - that the PPM must be replaced - since it cannot be expected to function reliably. The patient was admitted to the hospital - directly from the office.  The procedure was performed that evening. The was kept overnight for observation.    ======================   Manufacturer response for Pacemaker - Ingenio (per site reporter)  ======================  Two days after the device interrogation in the Device Clinic - the physician received follow-up from Boston Scientific engineers this afternoon - informing me that pacemaker battery has depleted abruptly and abnormally. As per physician - The battery will probably reach ERI by tomorrow - and EOL very soon after. Boston Scientific recommends the generator be replaced as soon as possible.  We are awaiting formal response after they have thoroughly examined the device.
Dual Chamber Temporary Pacemaker,Medtronic,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Potential for patient harm,06/26/2013,This 83 year old has a history of a mechanical mitral valve replacement about 22 years ago - hypertension - HLD - hypothyroidism - glaucoma and lower back pain. She was admitted about a month ago. She had re-do sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. She was in the ICU about 6 days when she was transferred to the telemetry unit. Two days later - during the day shift - the patient was in the bathroom and the RN noticed the call bell went off. When she arrived in the room - the CNA was walking the patient back to the chair. He had the pacemaker box under his arm and the cardiac monitor in hand. The patient said she felt like something popped. The epicardial wires were assessed and noted to be intact and secured. The patient complained of feeling like she was punched in the chest. The patient's rhythm that day was atrial fibrillation - the rate was controlled. The nurse checked the monitor and noted the patient was being incorrectly paced. The pacer box did not show ordered settings. The settings seen were 50/20/25. She turned the pacer box off and the patient reported relief from previous feeling. The cardiac PA was paged and came up to see the patient for bedside assessment. A new pacer box was placed with correct settings in place. It was determined with the PA that the emergency button must have been accidentally pushed. Pressing the emergency button initiates high output dual chamber asynchronous pacing.  All options on a pacer box are locked except for the emergency button. The box was sent to clinical engineering for evaluation. The evaluation of the pacer box did not identify any equipment malfunction. No safety device to prevent accidental push of emergency button. No harm to patient.      
,Medtronic,Cable Pacemaker,Potential for patient harm,06/12/2013,A semi-permanent pacer was being inserted and although the lead tested and functioned fine using alligators - when the Medtronic adapter cable (#5487) was attached using the usual IS 1 connector capture was absent or intermittent. A second cable (different lot #) was used with same issue. Attending Electro-physiologist was able to determine that repositioning (slightly pulling back) the cable in the connector seemed to fix the problem and capture was attained and maintained. A Medtronic technical representative - came into the lab and observed this and will report the event to Medtronic. This problem seemed to come from inserting the pin too far or pushing too hard and relieved by slightly pulling back. Medtronic will have a report generated with any suggestions to avoid this in the future.    ======================  Manufacturer response for Medtronic adapter cable (#5487) - Medtronic adapter cable (#5487) (per site reporter)  ======================  pending
Zephyr XL DR,St. Jude Medical,implantable pulse generator pacemaker,Not known,06/04/2013,Procedure performed: right and left coronary angiography and right iliofemoral angiography.  Patient has a  permanent pacemaker - ST Jude Medical model number 5826. Programmed in a DDDR mode at 70 beats /minute with a max track of 120 - upon cineangiography of the left main - the patient appeared to develop wide-complex tachycardia from a baseline of atrial pacing.  A magnet placed on the pacemaker slowed the rate.    It was determined that the pacemaker accelerometer was being activated by the cineangiography.    For the rest of the procedure recorded images on fluoroscopy.
CapSure;CapSureFix Novus;Adapta DR,Medtronic,Electrode Pacemaker;Implantable Pulse Generator Pacemaker,Death,05/20/2013,Dual chamber pacemaker implanted for the following indications: syncope - sick sinus syndrome - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - and 12-second pause with asystole. In the early morning hours roughly 1 week later the monitor strips indicate atrial spikes with no capture and ventricular spikes with widening QRS complex. Approximately 2 hours later the patient was found pulseless and apneic.
SureScan CapSureFix,MEDTRONIC INC,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,05/13/2013,This patient underwent Medtronic dual-chamber device insertion for trifascicular block. The patient was admitted six months later for evaluation of alteration in mental status. One day later the device was interrogated and the results reviewed.  The device shows normal function - and is generally pacing up to 60% to 70% of the time.  No arrhythmias detected.   The next day - the patient had a frank syncopal episode. Three days later - the cardiologist noted: The patient had multiple episodes of non-capture and pauses for several seconds overnight.  This was during sleep and he was asymptomatic.  The device interrogation reveals markedly elevated ventricular lead threshold and the output was increased to maximum of 6 V at 1.5 msec.  He says he feels tired and weak - and did not sleep well last night.  He has had a couple of episodes of dizziness. The patient underwent pacer lead extraction and pacer lead insertion and fluoroscopy. Notes from the operative report: Examination of the patient's lead under fluoroscopy was unrevealing.  The lead appeared to be in good position within the floor of the right ventricle and had active motion with heart beat.  There were no obvious lead fractures visible by fluoroscopic examination....A stylet was passed down the old right ventricular electrode and the active fixation device withdrawn.  Under fluoroscopic guidance with constant gentle traction and some rotational torsion - the old lead was removed.  Examination of the lead over its entire extent visually showed no evidence of abnormalities....  tolerated the procedure well.  
CapSureFix Novus,Medtronic Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management,permanent pacemaker electrode,Serious injury,05/09/2013,Patient had a right atrial lead and pacemaker originally implanted in Fall of 2012. In the spring of 2013 -  the patient was brought in because there was an issue with the device. The MD felt the lead was the problem - so he repositioned the lead - he did not remove it. The day after that - the device was still malfunctioning. MD felt lead not really needed anymore and so it was removed.    
,Medtronic,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,05/09/2013,Notes from the discharge summary: Recently - the patient has had symptoms of fatigue and pacemaker syndrome associated with dysfunction of his atrial pacer lead.  The patient has had multiple infections in the past and although the device had not reached elective replacement indicator (ERI) - it did have significant battery depletion.  Accordingly - the patient was admitted for atrial lead replacement and generator replacement...Hospital course:...the patient was taken to the operating room where his implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator was replaced and an uncomplicated atrial lead extraction/reinsertion was carried out.  Postoperatively - he had adequate pain management and his wound was healing without incident.  Please note - the ICD was implanted in Mexico and we do not have specific data for the implant.
Tendril Active Fixation Bipolar Lead,St Jude Medical,permanent pacemaker electrode endocardial pacing,Minor injury to the patient or health care provider,05/07/2013,Unable to place RA lead - due to high pacing thresholds. Removed and used different lead.
SelectSecure,Medtronic Inc.,permanent pacemaker electrode,Potential for patient harm,05/07/2013,Pacemaker RV lead extraction due to high thresholds.  Generator replaced at time of lead replacement. Patient with a history of AVNRT and CHB post ablation. She was initially implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker in 2010. The thresholds are elevated on the RV lead and the pocket was superficial. The patient was seen and examined by an electrophysiology staff physician and deemed appropriate for a lead extraction and pocket revision. The pocket was copiously irrigated with antibiotic containing normal saline and subsequently observed.  The lead tips for all leads were cleaned and dried thoroughly.  The leads were attached to the appropriate ports on the new pulse generator.  Tug testing was perfomed on all connections.  The device and leads were placed in an AIGIS pouch within the pocket such that the coiled redundant leads were posterior to the pulse generator. Successful lead extraction and re implant and pacemaker generator change.

Model 5348 Single Chamber Temporary Pacemaker,Medtronic,pulse-generator pacemaker external,Not applicable,04/19/2013,This temporary pacemaker device was connected to the patient with the following settings:  rate=40; output=5; sensitivity=0.5.  Pacemaker began pacing at 180 beats per minute and patient's blood pressure dropped.  MD called.  Pacer disconnected and patient's heartrate returned to a sinus rhythm in the 80s.  Systolic blood pressure was in the 140s.  Pacemaker settings confirmed by 3 RNs.  Pacemaker reattached and once again began pacing at 180 beats per minute. This pacemaker switched out and a second pacemaker was attached and worked appropriately as per original settings.  The external pacemaker in question was taken out of service.  There was no harm to the patient.    
Accent DR RF,St. Jude Medical Cardiac Rhythm Management Division,implantable pacemaker pulse generator,Potential for patient harm,04/12/2013,Patient had a permanent pacemaker implanted for symptomatic bradycardia - near syncope. On that pacemaker required removal and insertion of a new one secondary to loss of output on pacemaker from battery depletion.
Premium 6500,Medtronic,electrode pacemaker temporary,Potential for patient harm,04/05/2013,The physician was attempting to thread the pacer wire and needle to the heart when both broke from the physican's grasp and were retained in the patient.
,Medtronic Inc.,pacemaker external temporary,Not known,03/29/2013,Pt had a temporary pacemaker that stopped working during flight.  I had the RN prior to leaving the pt room change the battery and she did. The temporary pacemaker was working (showing green light in upper left hand corner). We left with the pt - loaded him into the helicopter - secured equipment - lifted - and noticed pt was not being paced.  Flight Registered Nurse (FRN) checked connection to box and to pt - and checked to make sure the battery was not put in backwards. The FRN check with pt continuous throughout flight to make sure pt was not developing chest pain (which he did not) and there was no change in pt's rhythm throughout care.  RN at hospital was told immediately when pt arrived to room and she went and got their temporary pacemaker and changed the pt over to theirs without incident.
CapSure Fix Novus,Medtronic Inc.,permanent pacemaker electrode lead pacing atrial,Potential for patient harm,03/22/2013,The right atrial lead was implanted then removed due to malfunction. Ultimately no atrial lead was implanted due to cardiac tamponade. The procedure was the implantation of a St. Jude implantable defibrillator with a Boston Scientific ventricular lead. During the placement of the Medtronic atrial lead - patient became acutely hypotensive and evidence of a pericardial effusion and tamponade was evident. With removal of the atrial lead - the pressure returned spontaneously to normal and the effusion began to lessen. Interventional Cardiology was at the bedside to evaluate the patient and they felt that careful monitoring of the effusion would be appropriate. The patient remained on the table for approximately an additional 45 minutes with stable blood pressures.  Although there was an acute complication from the implant - the patient is doing well and blood pressure is stable. He did not get an atrial lead because of this acute complication.
CapSureFix Novus;Protecta XT  CRT-D;Fidelis lead,Medtronic,permanent pacemaker electrode;defibrillator automatic implantable cardioverter with cardiac resynchronization,Potential for patient harm,03/11/2013,Fidelis lead removed and replaced. BI-V ICD was not recording any pacing. Medtronic recommended exchanging it out. Atrial lead removed because of high threshold.
tendril;Accent SR;IsoFlex Optim,St. Jude Medical Inc.,lead pacemaker;pulse generator pacemaker implantable,Potential for patient harm,02/13/2013,Pt. presented in complete heart block with atrial fibrillation and alternating right bundle and left bundle branch block pattern.  Pt had malfunction of previously paced lead in the right ventricle with intermittent capture. Cardiologist documented lead separated from the pulse generator and inspected.  The old lead had satisfactory capture - but was noted to have only intermittent capture at times on Holter. A decision was made to put a new screw in right ventricular lead at the cardiac apex because of the patient's severe tricuspid insufficiency.
CapSureFix Novus,Medtronic Cardiac Rhythm Management,lead pacemaker,Serious injury,12/19/2012,Patient with history of Ischemic CARDIOMYOPATHY and multiple AICD implantations. Last surgery (2004) was implantation of a biventricular generator from the right. At that time a right ventricular lead failed to sense well and was subsequently was abandoned and capped. The right ventricular and right atrial leads were successfully placed - however - coronary sinus lead could not be placed. The patient was recently found to have a fractured right atrial lead. Patient returned to hospital to remove defective atrial lead and alerted ventricular lead with replacement of generator. The remaining lead was interogated and found to be functioning well and then connected to a new Medtronic AICD.
EnRhythm,MEDTRONIC INC.,Pacemaker,Potential for patient harm,01/03/2013,Patient visited the Pacemaker Clinic approximately five months ago for routine interrogation of his pacemaker. Nurse's note now indicates PPM reached ERI approximately 6 months previous to this visit. Patient scheduled with surgeon - to be evaluated for generator replacement.  Patient had software patch approximately two years ago after manufacturer released software update. Premature battery depletion became a known battery issue two years ago. Patient is not pacemaker dependent. Patient is monitored every six months with telephone interrogation by PPM nurse. Patient also had one evaluation two months before clinic visit which indicated normal battery voltage. The patient was electively admitted on for PPM generator change.    ======================   Manufacturer response for Pacemaker - EnRhythm (per site reporter)  ======================  Thank you for returning the referenced device to Medtronic for evaluation.  This letter is to provide you with the analysis results.    It was reported the device was replaced because the battery lasted less than four years.  Preliminary and Functional analysis: Review of retrieved data - telemetry function - battery measurement - functionality of outputs and therapies - stability of internal circuits.  Findings: Preliminary and functional testing confirms this device was at ERI. The battery impedance was higher than normal. Based upon these findings this device satisfied the battery impedance criteria for meeting ERI. The ERI flag was triggered.  This device has experienced ERI due to a known battery issue communicated to physicians in February 2010. At that time we informed our customers of two specific battery issues with Enrhythm pacemakers that were subsequently addressed by a software update released in the fall of 2010. The software modified the EnRhythm ERI criteria - which now monitors nightly battery impedance in addition to nightly voltage for indicatin device replacement time.  Our most recent performance data shows 6-10% of devices from the population will trigger ERI within 5 years post-implant - with average longevity expectations for this device model remaining at 8.5 to 10.5 years.
